<h1>A look into Europe's economy and demography</h1>

<p>Europe is home to many countries with many different cultures and ways of life.</p>
<p>With the European Union, those countries represent one of the global power in international relations.</p>
<p>However, we could wonder how different are the living condition between those countries.</p>
<p>This visualization will aim at giving an overview of various economic and demographic aspects of European countries.</p>

<h2>Europe's population and GDP</h2>
<div id="map"></div>
  
<p>This map helps us visualize the geography of Europe and locate each countries.<p>
<p> It also gives a idea on how each country compares with one another regarding their GDP and population.
</p>

<h2>Life Expectancy of European countries against the median income </h2>
  
<div id="bubble"></div>
  
  <p>Life expectancy is clear indicator of living conditions.</p>
  <p>It seems that there might be a possible relation between the median income of a country and the average life expectancy.</p>
  <p>Also, it seems that countries with lower median income tend to also have a higher unemployment rate.</p>
  <p>The dotted line represents the average median income among the European countries.</p>

<h3>The relationship of Life Satisfaction, Job Satisfaction and Median Income</h3>

<div id="splom"></div>

  <p>Here we see that countries with higher job satisfaction, also have higher life satisfaction.</p>
  <p>This relationship seems to be linear.</p>
  <p>Again, Median Income seems to also have a relation with both life and job satisfaction.</p>
